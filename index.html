      <h1>Make the world's fiber intelligent</h1>
      <p>
        We build the intelligence layer for fiber optic infrastructure. Our research
        reduces data needs and accelerates labelling so operators can detect broken
        rails, pipeline intrusions, and structural issues in real time. Fully hardware
        agnostic.

          Trillions invested yet networks cannot see intrusions, overheating, or ground

          used for sensing.

        <h2>Our approach</h2>
        <p>
          We are developing a Large Vibration Model that learns across fibers, terrains,
          and events. It lowers data needs, improves accuracy, and keeps false positives
          near zero with contextual understanding.

          <li>OEM agnostic models</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>What this enables</h3>
        <p>
          Deploy intelligence on top of existing fiber. Start with one corridor and
          expand. Keep your hardware. Gain awareness today.

          Rail operators have searched for a reliable solution for decades. We target 50
          percent true detection in year one with near zero false positives and a
          deployment timeline measured in months.

        <h2>Why now</h2>
        <p>
          Risk is rising while fiber penetration is already high. AI advances finally
          allow learning from noisy high volume signals with far less data. Large vendors
          are focused on hardware which leaves the intelligence gap open.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>What changes with FiberMind</h3>
        <p>
          Turn light pulses into awareness. Treat fiber as the nervous system for rail,
          energy, and borders. Build once and scale across networks.

          We bring decades across DFOS, applied AI, and large scale deployments. We have
          built and shipped systems in rail, energy, and defense, and know the path from
          lab to live operations.
